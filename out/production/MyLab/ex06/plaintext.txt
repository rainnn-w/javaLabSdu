an algorithm is a specific procedure for solving a wellGdefined computational problemH the development and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to all aspects of computer scienceT artificial intelligenceF databasesF graphicsF networkingF operating systemsF securityF and so onH algorithm development is more than just programmingH it requires an understanding of the alternatives available for solving a computational problemF including the hardwareF networkingF programming languageF and performance constraints that accompany any particular solutionH it also requires understanding what it means for an algorithm to be correct in the sense that it fully and efficiently solves the problem at handH 

an accompanying notion is the design of a particular data structure that enables an algorithm to run efficientlyH the importance of data structures stems from the fact that the main memory of a computer Bwhere the data is storedC is linearF consisting of a sequence of memory cells that are serially numbered JF KF LFῲH thusF the simplest data structure is a linear arrayF in which adjacent elements are numbered with consecutive integer indexes and an element s value is accessed by its unique indexH an array can be usedF for exampleF to store a list of namesF and efficient methods are needed to efficiently search for and retrieve a particular name from the arrayH for exampleF sorting the list into alphabetical order permits a soGcalled binary search technique to be usedF in which the remainder of the list to be searched at each step is cut in halfH this search technique is similar to searching a telephone book for a particular nameH knowing that the book is in alphabetical order allows one to turn quickly to a page that is close to the page containing the desired nameH many algorithms have been developed for sorting and searching lists of data efficientlyH 

although data items are stored consecutively in memoryF they may be linked together by pointers BessentiallyF memory addresses stored with an item to indicate where the next item or items in the structure are foundC so that the data can be organized in ways similar to those in which they will be accessedH the simplest such structure is called the linked listF in which noncontiguously stored items may be accessed in a preGspecified order by following the pointers from one item in the list to the nextH the list may be circularF with the last item pointing to the firstF or each element may have pointers in both directions to form a doubly linked listH algorithms have been developed for efficiently manipulating such lists by searching forF insertingF and removing itemsH 

pointers also provide the ability to implement more complex data structuresH a graphF for exampleF is a set of nodes BitemsC and links Bknown as edgesC that connect pairs of itemsH such a graph might represent a set of cities and the highways joining themF the layout of circuit elements and connecting wires on a memory chipF or the configuration of persons interacting via a social networkH typical graph algorithms include graph traversal strategiesF such as how to follow the links from node to node Bperhaps searching for a node with a particular propertyC in a way that each node is visited only onceH a related problem is the determination of the shortest path between two given nodes on an arbitrary graphH Bsee graph theoryHC a problem of practical interest in network algorithmsF for instanceF is to determine how many broken links can be tolerated before communications begin to failH similarlyF in veryGlargeGscale integration BvlsiC chip design it is important to know whether the graph representing a circuit is planarF that isF whether it can be drawn in two dimensions without any links crossing Bwires touchingCH 

the BcomputationalC complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of computing resources Btime and spaceC that a particular algorithm consumes when it runsH computer scientists use mathematical measures of complexity that allow them to predictF before writing the codeF how fast an algorithm will run and how much memory it will requireH such predictions are important guides for programmers implementing and selecting algorithms for realGworld applicationsH 

computational complexity is a continuumF in that some algorithms require linear time Bthat isF the time required increases directly with the number of items or nodes in the listF graphF or network being processedCF whereas others require quadratic or even exponential time to complete Bthat isF the time required increases with the number of items squared or with the exponential of that numberCH at the far end of this continuum lie the murky seas of intractable problemsῠthose whose solutions cannot be efficiently implementedH for these problemsF computer scientists seek to find heuristic algorithms that can almost solve the problem and run in a reasonable amount of timeH 

further away still are those algorithmic problems that can be stated but are not solvableU that isF one can prove that no program can be written to solve the problemH a classic example of an unsolvable algorithmic problem is the halting problemF which states that no program can be written that can predict whether or not any other program halts after a finite number of stepsH the unsolvability of the halting problem has immediate practical bearing on software developmentH for instanceF it would be frivolous to try to develop a software tool that predicts whether another program being developed has an infinite loop in it Balthough having such a tool would be immensely beneficialCH 

architecture and organization 
computer architecture deals with the design of computersF data storage devicesF and networking components that store and run programsF transmit dataF and drive interactions between computersF across networksF and with usersH computer architects use parallelism and various strategies for memory organization to design computing systems with very high performanceH computer architecture requires strong communication between computer scientists and computer engineersF since they both focus fundamentally on hardware designH 

at its most fundamental levelF a computer consists of a control unitF an arithmetic logic unit BaluCF a memory unitF and inputIoutput BiIoC controllersH the alu performs simple additionF subtractionF multiplicationF divisionF and logic operationsF such as or and andH the memory stores the program s instructions and dataH the control unit fetches data and instructions from memory and uses operations of the alu to carry out those instructions using that dataH Bthe control unit and alu together are referred to as the central processing unit ucpuwHC when an input or output instruction is encounteredF the control unit transfers the data between the memory and the designated iIo controllerH the operational speed of the cpu primarily determines the speed of the computer as a wholeH all of these componentsῠthe control unitF the aluF the memoryF and the iIo controllersῠare realized with transistor circuitsH 

computers also have another level of memory called a cacheF a smallF extremely fast Bcompared with the main memoryF or random access memory uramwC unit that can be used to store information that is urgently or frequently neededH current research includes cache design and algorithms that can predict what data is likely to be needed next and preload it into the cache for improved performanceH

the operation of a computerF once a program and some data have been loaded into ramF takes place as followsH the first instruction is transferred from ram into the control unit and interpreted by the hardware circuitryH for instanceF suppose that the instruction is a string of bits that is the code for load KJH this instruction loads the contents of memory location KJ into the aluH the next instructionF say add KOF is fetchedH the control unit then loads the contents of memory location KO into the alu and adds it to the number already thereH finallyF the instruction store LJ would store that sum into location LJH at this levelF the operation of a computer is not much different from that of a pocket calculatorH 

in generalF programs are not just lengthy sequences of loadF storeF and arithmetic operationsH most importantlyF computer languages include conditional instructionsῠessentiallyF rules that sayF if memory location n satisfies condition aF do instruction number x nextF otherwise do instruction yH this allows the course of a program to be determined by the results of previous operationsῠa critically important abilityH 

finallyF programs typically contain sequences of instructions that are repeated a number of times until a predetermined condition becomes trueH such a sequence is called a loopH for exampleF a loop would be needed to compute the sum of the first n integersF where n is a value stored in a separate memory locationH computer architectures that can execute sequences of instructionsF conditional instructionsF and loops are called turing completeF which means that they can carry out the execution of any algorithm that can be definedH turing completeness is a fundamental and essential characteristic of any computer organizationH 

logic design is the area of computer science that deals with the design of electronic circuits using the fundamental principles and properties of logic Bsee boolean algebraC to carry out the operations of the control unitF the aluF the iIo controllersF and other hardwareH each logical function BandF orF and notC is realized by a particular type of device called a gateH for exampleF the addition circuit of the alu has inputs corresponding to all the bits of the two numbers to be added and outputs corresponding to the bits of the sumH the arrangement of wires and gates that link inputs to outputs is determined by the mathematical definition of additionH the design of the control unit provides the circuits that interpret instructionsH due to the need for efficiencyF logic design must also optimize the circuitry to function with maximum speed and has a minimum number of gates and circuitsH 

an important area related to architecture is the design of microprocessorsF which are complete cpusῠcontrol unitF aluF and memoryῠon a single integrated circuit chipH additional memory and iIo control circuitry are linked to this chip to form a complete computerH these thumbnailGsized devices contain millions of transistors that implement the processing and memory units of modern computersH 

vlsi microprocessor design occurs in a number of stagesF which include creating the initial functional or behavioral specificationF encoding this specification into a hardware description languageF and breaking down the design into modules and generating sizes and shapes for the eventual chip componentsH it also involves chip planningF which includes building a floor plan to indicate where on the chip each component should be placed and connected to other componentsH computer scientists are also involved in creating the computerGaided design BcadC tools that support engineers in the various stages of chip design and in developing the necessary theoretical resultsF such as how to efficiently design a floor plan with nearGminimal area that satisfies the given constraintsH

fault tolerance is the ability of a computer to continue operation when one or more of its components failsH to ensure fault toleranceF key components are often replicated so that the backup component can take over if neededH such applications as aircraft control and manufacturing process control run on systems with backup processors ready to take over if the main processor failsF and the backup systems often run in parallel so the transition is smoothH if the systems are critical in that their failure would be potentially disastrous Bas in aircraft controlCF incompatible outcomes collected from replicated processes running in parallel on separate machines are resolved by a voting mechanismH computer scientists are involved in the analysis of such replicated systemsF providing theoretical approaches to estimating the reliability achieved by a given configuration and processor parametersF such as average time between failures and average time required to repair the processorH fault tolerance is also a desirable feature in distributed systems and networksH for exampleF an advantage of a distributed database is that data replicated on different network hosts can provide a natural backup mechanism when one host failsH 

computational science 
computational science applies computer simulationF scientific visualizationF mathematical modelingF algorithmsF data structuresF networkingF database designF symbolic computationF and highGperformance computing to help advance the goals of various disciplinesH these disciplines include biologyF chemistryF fluid dynamicsF archaeologyF financeF sociologyF and forensicsH computational science has evolved rapidlyF especially because of the dramatic growth in the volume of data transmitted from scientific instrumentsH this phenomenon has been called the big data problemH 

the mathematical methods needed for computational science require the transformation of equations and functions from the continuous to the discreteH for exampleF the computer integration of a function over an interval is accomplished not by applying integral calculus but rather by approximating the area under the function graph as a sum of the areas obtained from evaluating the function at discrete pointsH similarlyF the solution of a differential equation is obtained as a sequence of discrete points determined by approximating the true solution curve by a sequence of tangential line segmentsH when discretized in this wayF many problems can be recast as an equation involving a matrix Ba rectangular array of numbersC solvable using linear algebraH numerical analysis is the study of such computational methodsH several factors must be considered when applying numerical methodsT BKC the conditions under which the method yields a solutionF BLC the accuracy of the solutionF BMC whether the solution process is stable BiHeHF does not exhibit error growthCF and BNC the computational complexity Bin the sense described aboveC of obtaining a solution of the desired accuracyH 

the requirements of bigGdata scientific problemsF including the solution of ever larger systems of equationsF engage the use of large and powerful arrays of processors Bcalled multiprocessors or supercomputersC that allow many calculations to proceed in parallel by assigning them to separate processing elementsH these activities have sparked much interest in parallel computer architecture and algorithms that can be carried out efficiently on such machinesH

applications of graphics include cadF fine artsF medical imagingF scientific data visualizationF and video gamesH cad systems allow the computer to be used for designing objects ranging from automobile parts to bridges to computer chips by providing an interactive drawing tool and an engineering interface to simulation and analysis toolsH fine arts applications allow artists to use the computer screen as a medium to create imagesF cinematographic special effectsF animated cartoonsF and television commercialsH medical imaging applications involve the visualization of data obtained from technologies such as xGrays and magnetic resonance imaging BmrisC to assist doctors in diagnosing medical conditionsH scientific visualization uses massive amounts of data to define simulations of scientific phenomenaF such as ocean modelingF to produce pictures that provide more insight into the phenomena than would tables of numbersH graphics also provide realistic visualizations for video gamingF flight simulationF and other representations of reality or fantasyH the term virtual reality has been coined to refer to any interaction with a computerGsimulated virtual worldH 

a challenge for computer graphics is the development of efficient algorithms that manipulate the myriad of linesF trianglesF and polygons that make up a computer imageH in order for realistic onGscreen images to be presentedF each object must be rendered as a set of planar unitsH edges must be smoothed and textured so that their underlying construction from polygons is not obvious to the naked eyeH in many applicationsF still pictures are inadequateF and rapid display of realGtime images is requiredH both extremely efficient algorithms and stateGofGtheGart hardware are needed to accomplish realGtime animationH Bfor more technical details of graphics displaysF see computer graphicsHC 

humanGcomputer interaction 
humanGcomputer interaction BhciC is concerned with designing effective interaction between users and computers and the construction of interfaces that support this interactionH hci occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardwareH user interface design impacts the life cycle of softwareF so it should occur early in the design processH because user interfaces must accommodate a variety of user styles and capabilitiesF hci research draws on several disciplines including psychologyF sociologyF anthropologyF and engineeringH in the KSPJsF user interfaces consisted of computer consoles that allowed an operator directly to type commands that could be executed immediately or at some future timeH with the advent of more userGfriendly personal computers in the KSRJsF user interfaces became more sophisticatedF so that the user could point and click to send a command to the operating systemH 

thusF the field of hci emerged to modelF developF and measure the effectiveness of various types of interfaces between a computer application and the person accessing its servicesH guis enable users to communicate with the computer by such simple means as pointing to an icon with a mouse or touching it with a stylus or forefingerH this technology also supports windowing environments on a computer screenF which allow users to work with different applications simultaneouslyF one in each windowH 

information management 
information management BimC is primarily concerned with the captureF digitizationF representationF organizationF transformationF and presentation of informationH because a computer s main memory provides only temporary storageF computers are equipped with auxiliary disk storage devices that permanently store dataH these devices are characterized by having much higher capacity than main memory but slower readIwrite BaccessC speedH data stored on a disk must be read into main memory before it can be processedH a major goal of im systemsF thereforeF is to develop efficient algorithms to store and retrieve specific data for processingH 

im systems comprise databases and algorithms for the efficient storageF retrievalF updatingF and deleting of specific items in the databaseH the underlying structure of a database is a set of files residing permanently on a disk storage deviceH each file can be further broken down into a series of recordsF which contains individual data itemsF or fieldsH each field gives the value of some property Bor attributeC of the entity represented by a recordH for exampleF a personnel file may contain a series of recordsF one for each individual in the organizationF and each record would contain fields that contain that person s nameF addressF phone numberF eGmail addressF and so forthH 

many file systems are sequentialF meaning that successive records are processed in the order in which they are storedF starting from the beginning and proceeding to the endH this file structure was particularly popular in the early days of computingF when files were stored on reels of magnetic tape and these reels could be processed only in a sequential mannerH sequential files are generally stored in some sorted order BeHgHF alphabeticC for printing of reports BeHgHF a telephone directoryC and for efficient processing of batches of transactionsH banking transactions Bdeposits and withdrawalsCF for instanceF might be sorted in the same order as the accounts fileF so that as each transaction is read the system need only scan ahead to find the accounts record to which it appliesH 

with modern storage systemsF it is possible to access any data record in a random fashionH to facilitate efficient random accessF the data records in a file are stored with indexes called keysH an index of a file is much like an index of a bookU it contains a key for each record in the file along with the location where the record is storedH since indexes might be longF they are usually structured in some hierarchical fashion so that they can be navigated efficientlyH the top level of an indexF for exampleF might contain locations of Bpoint toC indexes to items beginning with the letters aF bF etcH the a index itself may contain not locations of data items but pointers to indexes of items beginning with the letters abF acF and so onH locating the index for the desired record by traversing a treelike structure is quite efficientH 

many applications require access to many independent files containing related and even overlapping dataH their information management activities frequently require data from several files to be linkedF and hence the need for a database model emergesH historicallyF three different types of database models have been developed to support the linkage of records of different typesT BKC the hierarchical modelF in which record types are linked in a treelike structure BeHgHF employee records might be grouped under records describing the departments in which employees workCF BLC the network modelF in which arbitrary linkages of record types may be created BeHgHF employee records might be linked on one hand to employees departments and on the other hand to their supervisorsῠthat isF other employeesCF and BMC the relational modelF in which all data are represented in simple tabular formH 

in the relational modelF each individual entry is described by the set of its attribute values Bcalled a relationCF stored in one row of the tableH this linkage of n attribute values to provide a meaningful description of a realGworld entity or a relationship among such entities forms a mathematical nGtupleH the relational model also supports queries Brequests for informationC that involve several tables by providing automatic linkage across tables by means of a join operation that combines records with identical values of common attributesH payroll dataF for exampleF can be stored in one table and personnel benefits data in anotherU complete information on an employee could be obtained by joining the two tables using the employee s unique identification number as a common attributeH 

to support database processingF a software artifact known as a database management system BdbmsC is required to manage the data and provide the user with commands to retrieve information from the databaseH for exampleF a widely used dbms that supports the relational model is mysqlH 

another development in database technology is to incorporate the object conceptH in objectGoriented databasesF all data are objectsH objects may be linked together by an isGpartGof relationship to represent largerF composite objectsH data describing a truckF for instanceF may be stored as a composite of a particular engineF chassisF drive trainF and so forthH classes of objects may form a hierarchy in which individual objects may inherit properties from objects farther up in the hierarchyH for exampleF objects of the class motorized vehicle all have an engineU members of the subclasses truck or airplane will then also have an engineH 

nosqlF or nonGrelational databasesF have also emergedH these databases are different from the classic relational databases because they do not require fixed tablesH many of them are documentGoriented databasesF in which voiceF musicF imagesF and video clips are stored along with traditional textual informationH an important subset of nosql are the xml databasesF which are widely used in the development of android smartphone and tablet applicationsH 

data integrity refers to designing a dbms that ensures the correctness and stability of its data across all applications that access the systemH when a database is designedF integrity checking is enabled by specifying the data type of each column in the tableH for exampleF if an identification number is specified to be nine digitsF the dbms will reject an update attempting to assign a value with more or fewer digits or one including an alphabetic characterH another type of integrityF known as referential integrityF requires that each entity referenced by some other entity must itself exist in the databaseH for exampleF if an airline reservation is requested for a particular flight numberF then the flight referenced by that number must actually existH 

access to a database by multiple simultaneous users requires that the dbms include a concurrency control mechanism Bcalled lockingC to maintain integrity whenever two different users attempt to access the same data at the same timeH for exampleF two travel agents may try to book the last seat on a plane at more or less the same timeH without concurrency controlF both may think they have succeededF though only one booking is actually entered into the databaseH 

a key concept in studying concurrency control and the maintenance of data integrity is the transactionF defined as an indivisible operation that transforms the database from one state into anotherH to illustrateF consider an electronic transfer of funds of >O from bank account a to account bH the operation that deducts >O from account a leaves the database without integrity since the total over all accounts is >O shortH similarlyF the operation that adds >O to account b in itself makes the total >O too muchH combining these two operations into a single transactionF howeverF maintains data integrityH the key here is to ensure that only complete transactions are applied to the data and that multiple concurrent transactions are executed using locking so that serializing them would produce the same resultH a transactionGoriented control mechanism for database access becomes difficult in the case of a long transactionF for exampleF when several engineers are workingF perhaps over the course of several daysF on a product design that may not exhibit data integrity until the project is completeH 

as mentioned previouslyF a database may be distributed in that its data can be spread among different host computers on a networkH if the distributed data contains duplicatesF the concurrency control problem is more complexH distributed databases must have a distributed dbms to provide overall control of queries and updates in a manner that does not require that the user know the location of the dataH a closely related concept is interoperabilityF meaning the ability of the user of one member of a group of disparate systems Ball having the same functionalityC to work with any of the systems of the group with equal ease and via the same interfaceH

networking and communication 
the field of networking and communication includes the analysisF designF implementationF and use of localF wideGareaF and mobile networks that link computers togetherH the internet itself is a network that makes it feasible for nearly all computers in the world to communicateH 

a computer network links computers together via a combination of infrared light signalsF radio wave transmissionsF telephone linesF television cablesF and satellite linksH the challenge for computer scientists has been to develop protocols Bstandardized rules for the format and exchange of messagesC that allow processes running on host computers to interpret the signals they receive and to engage in meaningful conversations in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of usersH network protocols also include flow controlF which keeps a data sender from swamping a receiver with messages that it has no time to process or space to storeF and error controlF which involves transmission error detection and automatic resending of messages to correct such errorsH Bfor some of the technical details of error detection and correctionF see information theoryHC 

open systems interconnection BosiC 
open systems interconnection BosiC 
the standardization of protocols is an international effortH since it would otherwise be impossible for different kinds of machines and operating systems to communicate with one anotherF the key concern has been that system components BcomputersC be openH this terminology comes from the open systems interconnection BosiC communication standardsF established by the international organization for standardizationH the osi reference model specifies network protocol standards in seven layersH each layer is defined by the functions it relies upon from the layer below it and by the services it provides to the layer above itH 

at the bottom of the protocol lies the physical layerF containing rules for the transport of bits across a physical linkH the dataGlink layer handles standardGsized packets of data and adds reliability in the form of error detection and flow control bitsH the network and transport layers break messages into the standardGsize packets and route them to their destinationsH the session layer supports interactions between applications on two communicating machinesH for exampleF it provides a mechanism with which to insert checkpoints Bsaving the current status of a taskC into a long file transfer so thatF in case of a failureF only the data after the last checkpoint need to be retransmittedH the presentation layer is concerned with functions that encode dataF so that heterogeneous systems may engage in meaningful communicationH at the highest level are protocols that support specific applicationsH an example of such an application is the file transfer protocol BftpCF which governs the transfer of files from one host to anotherH 

the development of networks and communication protocols has also spawned distributed systemsF in which computers linked in a network share data and processing tasksH a distributed database systemF for exampleF has a database spread among Bor replicated atC different network sitesH data are replicated at mirror sitesF and replication can improve availability and reliabilityH a distributed dbms manages a database whose components are distributed across several computers on a networkH 

a clientGserver network is a distributed system in which the database resides on one computer Bthe serverC and the users connect to this computer over the network from their own computers Bthe clientsCH the server provides data and responds to requests from each clientF while each client accesses the data on the server in a way that is independent and ignorant of the presence of other clients accessing the same databaseH clientGserver systems require that individual actions from several clients to the same part of the server s database be synchronizedF so that conflicts are resolved in a reasonable wayH for exampleF airline reservations are implemented using a clientGserver modelH the server contains all the data about upcoming flightsF such as current bookings and seat assignmentsH each client wants to access this data for the purpose of booking a flightF obtaining a seat assignmentF and paying for the flightH during this processF it is likely that two or more client requests want to access the same flight and that there is only one seat left to be assignedH the software must synchronize these two requests so that the remaining seat is assigned in a rational way Busually to the person who made the request firstCH 

another popular type of distributed system is the peerGtoGpeer networkH unlike clientGserver networksF a peerGtoGpeer network assumes that each computer BuserC connected to it can act both as a client and as a serverU thusF everyone on the network is a peerH this strategy makes sense for groups that share audio collections on the internet and for organizing social networks such as linkedin and facebookH each person connected to such a network both receives information from others and shares his or her own information with othersH 

operating systems 
an operating system is a specialized collection of software that stands between a computer s hardware architecture and its applicationsH it performs a number of fundamental activities such as file system managementF process schedulingF memory allocationF network interfacingF and resource sharing among the computer s usersH operating systems have evolved in their complexity over timeF beginning with the earliest computers in the KSPJsH 

with early computersF the user typed programs onto punched tape or cardsF which were read into the computerF assembled or compiledF and runH the results were then transmitted to a printer or a magnetic tapeH these early operating systems engaged in batch processingU iHeHF handling sequences of jobs that are compiled and executed one at a time without intervention by the userH accompanying each job in a batch were instructions to the operating system BosC detailing the resources needed by the jobF such as the amount of cpu time requiredF the files neededF and the storage devices on which the files residedH from these beginnings came the key concept of an operating system as a resource allocatorH this role became more important with the rise of multiprogrammingF in which several jobs reside in the computer simultaneously and share resourcesF for exampleF by being allocated fixed amounts of cpu time in turnH more sophisticated hardware allowed one job to be reading data while another wrote to a printer and still another performed computationsH the operating system thus managed these tasks in such a way that all the jobs were completed without interfering with one anotherH 

the advent of time sharingF in which users enter commands and receive results directly at a terminalF added more tasks to the operating systemH processes known as terminal handlers were neededF along with mechanisms such as interrupts Bto get the attention of the operating system to handle urgent tasksC and buffers Bfor temporary storage of data during inputIoutput to make the transfer run more smoothlyCH modern large computers interact with hundreds of users simultaneouslyF giving each one the perception of being the sole userH 

another area of operating system research is the design of virtual memoryH virtual memory is a scheme that gives users the illusion of working with a large block of contiguous memory space Bperhaps even larger than real memoryCF when in actuality most of their work is on auxiliary storage BdiskCH fixedGsize blocks BpagesC or variableGsize blocks BsegmentsC of the job are read into main memory as neededH questions such as how much main memory space to allocate to users and which pages or segments should be returned to disk B swapped out C to make room for incoming pages or segments must be addressed in order for the system to execute jobs efficientlyH 

the first commercially viable operating systems were developed by ibm in the KSPJs and were called osIMPJ and dosIMPJH unix was developed at bell laboratories in the early KSQJs and since has spawned many variantsF including linuxF berkeley unixF gnuF and apple s iosH operating systems developed for the first personal computers in the KSRJs included ibm s Band later microsoft sC dosF which evolved into various flavours of windowsH an important LKstGcentury development in operating systems was that they became increasingly machineGindependentH 

parallel and distributed computing 
the simultaneous growth in availability of big data and in the number of simultaneous users on the internet places particular pressure on the need to carry out computing tasks in parallelF or simultaneouslyH parallel and distributed computing occurs across many different topic areas in computer scienceF including algorithmsF computer architectureF networksF operating systemsF and software engineeringH during the early LKst century there was explosive growth in multiprocessor design and other strategies for complex applications to run fasterH parallel and distributed computing builds on fundamental systems conceptsF such as concurrencyF mutual exclusionF consistency in stateImemory manipulationF messageGpassingF and sharedGmemory modelsH 

creating a multiprocessor from a number of single cpus requires physical links and a mechanism for communication among the processors so that they may operate in parallelH tightly coupled multiprocessors share memory and hence may communicate by storing information in memory accessible by all processorsH loosely coupled multiprocessorsF including computer networksF communicate by sending messages to each other across the physical linksH computer scientists have investigated various multiprocessor architecturesH for exampleF the possible configurations in which hundreds or even thousands of processors may be linked together are examined to find the geometry that supports the most efficient system throughputH a muchGstudied topology is the hypercubeF in which each processor is connected directly to some fixed number of neighboursT two for the twoGdimensional squareF three for the threeGdimensional cubeF and similarly for the higherGdimensional hypercubesH computer scientists also investigate methods for carrying out computations on such multiprocessor machines BeHgHF algorithms to make optimal use of the architecture and techniques to avoid conflicts in data transmissionCH the machineGresident software that makes possible the use of a particular machineF in particular its operating systemF is an integral part of this investigationH 

concurrency refers to the execution of more than one procedure at the same time Bperhaps with the access of shared dataCF either truly simultaneously Bas on a multiprocessorC or in an unpredictably interleaved orderH modern programming languages such as java include both encapsulation and features called threads that allow the programmer to define the synchronization that occurs among concurrent procedures or tasksH 

two important issues in concurrency control are known as deadlocks and race conditionsH deadlock occurs when a resource held indefinitely by one process is requested by two or more other processes simultaneouslyH as a resultF none of the processes that call for the resource can continueU they are deadlockedF waiting for the resource to be freedH an operating system can handle this situation with various prevention or detection and recovery techniquesH a race conditionF on the other handF occurs when two or more concurrent processes assign a different value to a variableF and the result depends on which process assigns the variable first Bor lastCH 

preventing deadlocks and race conditions is fundamentally importantF since it ensures the integrity of the underlying applicationH a general prevention strategy is called process synchronizationH synchronization requires that one process wait for another to complete some operation before proceedingH for exampleF one process Ba writerC may be writing data to a certain main memory areaF while another process Ba readerC may want to read data from that areaH the reader and writer must be synchronized so that the writer does not overwrite existing data until the reader has processed itH similarlyF the reader should not start to read until data has been written in the areaH 

with the advent of networksF distributed computing became feasibleH a distributed computation is one that is carried out by a group of linked computers working cooperativelyH such computing usually requires a distributed operating system to manage the distributed resourcesH important concerns are workload sharingF which attempts to take advantage of access to multiple computers to complete jobs fasterU task migrationF which supports workload sharing by efficiently distributing jobs among machinesU and automatic task replicationF which occurs at different sites for greater reliabilityH 

platformGbased development 
platformGbased development is concerned with the design and development of applications for specific types of computers and operating systems B platforms CH platformGbased development takes into account systemGspecific characteristicsF such as those found in web programmingF multimedia developmentF mobile application developmentF and roboticsH platforms such as the internet or an android tablet enable students to learn within and about environments constrained by specific hardwareF application programming interfaces BapisCF and special servicesH these environments are sufficiently different from general purpose programming to warrant separate research and development effortsH 

for exampleF consider the development of an application for an android tabletH the android programming platform is called the dalvic virtual machine BdvmCF and the language is a variant of javaH howeverF an android application is defined not just as a collection of objects and methods butF moreoverF as a collection of intents and activitiesF which correspond roughly to the gui screens that the user sees when operating the applicationH xml programming is needed as wellF since it is the language that defines the layout of the application s user interfaceH finallyF iIo synchronization in android application development is more demanding than that found on conventional platformsF though some principles of java file management carry overH 

realGtime systems provide a broader setting in which platformGbased development takes placeH the term realGtime systems refers to computers embedded into carsF aircraftF manufacturing assembly linesF and other devices to control processes in real timeH frequentlyF realGtime tasks repeat at fixedGtime intervalsH for exampleF sensor data are gathered every secondF and a control signal is generatedH in such casesF scheduling theory is used to determine how the tasks should be scheduled on a given processorH a good example of a system that requires realGtime action is the antilock braking system BabsC on an automobileU because it is critical that the abs instantly reacts to brakeGpedal pressure and begins a program of pumping the brakesF such an application is said to have a hard deadlineH other realGtime systems are said to have soft deadlinesF in that no disaster will happen if the system s response is slightly delayedU an example is an order shipping and tracking systemH the concept of best effort arises in realGtime system designF because soft deadlines sometimes slip and hard deadlines are sometimes met by computing a less than optimal resultH for exampleF most details on an air traffic controller s screen are approximations BeHgHF altitudeC that need not be computed more precisely BeHgHF to the nearest inchC in order to be effectiveH 

programming languages 
programming languages are the languages with which a programmer implements a piece of software to run on a computerH the earliest programming languages were assembly languagesF not far removed from the binaryGencoded instructions directly executed by the computerH by the midGKSOJsF programmers began to use higherGlevel languagesH 

two of the first higherGlevel languages were fortran Bformula translatorC and algol Balgorithmic languageCF which allowed programmers to write algebraic expressions and solve scientific computing problemsH as learning to program became increasingly important in the KSPJsF a strippedGdown version of fortran called basic Bbeginner s allGpurpose symbolic instruction codeC was developed at dartmouth collegeH basic quickly spread to other academic institutionsF and by KSRJ versions of basic for personal computers allowed even students at elementary schools to learn the fundamentals of programmingH alsoF in the midGKSOJsF cobol Bcommon businessGoriented languageC was developed to support business programming applications that involved managing information stored in records and filesH 

the trend since then has been toward developing increasingly abstract languagesF allowing the programmer to communicate with the machine at a level ever more remote from machine codeH cobolF fortranF and their descendants Bpascal and cF for exampleC are known as imperative languagesF since they specify as a sequence of explicit commands how the machine is to go about solving the problem at handH these languages were also known as procedural languagesF since they allowed programmers to develop and reuse proceduresF subroutinesF and functions to avoid reinventing basic tasks for every new applicationH 

other highGlevel languages are called functional languagesF in that a program is viewed as a collection of BmathematicalC functions and its semantics are very precisely definedH the bestGknown functional language of this type is lisp Blist processingCF which in the KSPJs was the mainstay programming language for ai applicationsH successors to lisp in the ai community include schemeF prologF and c and cEE Bsee belowCH scheme is similar to lisp except that it has a more formal mathematical definitionH prolog has been used largely for logic programmingF and its applications include natural language understanding and expert systems such as mycinH prolog is notably a soGcalled nonproceduralF or declarativeF language in the sense that the programmer specifies what goals are to be accomplished but not how specific methods are to be applied to attain those goalsH c and cEE have been used widely in roboticsF an important application of ai researchH an extension of logic programming is constraint logic programmingF in which pattern matching is replaced by the more general operation of constraint satisfactionH 

another important development in programming languages through the KSRJs was the addition of support for data encapsulationF which gave rise to objectGoriented languagesH the original objectGoriented language was called smalltalkF in which all programs were represented as collections of objects communicating with each other via messageGpassingH an object is a set of data together with the methods BfunctionsC that can transform that dataH encapsulation refers to the fact that an object s data can be accessed only through these methodsH objectGoriented programming has been very influential in computingH languages for objectGoriented programming include cEEF visual basicF and javaH 

java is unusual because its applications are translated not into a particular machine language but into an intermediate language called java bytecodeF which runs on the java virtual machine BjvmCH programs on the jvm can be executed on most contemporary computer platformsF including intelGbased systemsF apple macintoshesF and various androidGbased smartphones and tabletsH thusF linuxF iosF windowsF and other operating systems can run java programsF which makes java ideal for creating distributed and webGbased applicationsH residing on webGbased serversF java programs may be downloaded and run in any standard web browser to provide access to various servicesF such as a client interface to a game or entry to a database residing on a serverH 

at a still higher level of abstraction lie declarative and scripting languagesF which are strictly interpreted languages and often drive applications running in web browsers and mobile devicesH some declarative languages allow programmers to conveniently access and retrieve information from a database using queriesF which are declarations of what to do Brather than how to do itCH a widely used database query language is sql Bstructured query languageC and its variants BeHgHF mysql and sqliteCH associated with these declarative languages are those that describe the layout of a web page on the user s screenH for exampleF html Bhypertext markup languageC supports the design of web pages by specifying their structure and contentH gluing the web page together with the database is the task of a scripting language BeHgHF phpCF which is a vehicle for programmers to integrate declarative statements of html and mysql with imperative actions that are required to effect an interaction between the user and the databaseH an example is an online book order with amazonHcomF where the user queries the database to find out what books are available and then initiates an order by pressing buttons and filling appropriate text areas with his or her ordering informationH the software that underlies this activity includes html to describe the content of the web pageF mysql to access the database according to the user s requestsF and php to control the overall flow of the transactionH 

computer programs written in any language other than machine language must be either interpreted or translated into machine language B compiled CH as suggested aboveF an interpreter is software that examines a computer program one instruction at a time and calls on code to execute the machine operations required by that instructionH 

a compiler is software that translates an entire computer program into machine code that is saved for subsequent execution whenever desiredH much work has been done on making both the compilation process and the compiled code as efficient as possibleH when a new language is developedF it is usually interpreted at firstH if it later becomes popularF a compiler is developed for itF since compilation is more efficient than interpretationH 

there is an intermediate approachF which is to compile code not into machine language but into an intermediate language Bcalled a virtual machineC that is close enough to machine language that it is efficient to interpretF though not so close that it is tied to the machine language of a particular computerH it is this approach that provides the java language with its computer platform independence via the jvmH 

security and information assurance

security and information assurance refers to policy and technical elements that protect information systems by ensuring their availabilityF integrityF authenticationF and appropriate levels of confidentialityH information security concepts occur in many areas of computer scienceF including operating systemsF computer networksF databasesF and softwareH 

operating system security involves protection from outside attacks by malicious software that interferes with the system s completion of ordinary tasksH network security provides protection of entire networks from attacks by outsidersH information in databases is especially vulnerable to being stolenF destroyedF or modified maliciously when the database server is accessible to multiple users over a networkH the first line of defense is to allow access to a computer only to authorized users by authenticating those users by a password or similar mechanismH 

howeverF clever programmers Bknown as hackersC have learned how to evade such mechanisms by designing computer virusesF programs that replicate themselvesF spread among the computers in a networkF and infect systems by destroying resident files and applicationsH data can be stolen by using devices such as trojan horsesF programs that carry out a useful task but also contain hidden malicious codeF or simply by eavesdropping on network communicationsH the need to protect sensitive data BeHgHF to protect national security or individual privacyC has led to advances in cryptography and the development of encryption standards that provide a high level of confidence that the data is safe from decoding by even the most clever attacksH 

software engineering 
software engineering is the discipline concerned with the application of theoryF knowledgeF and practice to building reliable software systems that satisfy the computing requirements of customers and usersH it is applicable to smallGF mediumGF and largeGscale computing systems and organizationsH software engineering uses engineering methodsF processesF techniquesF and measurementsH software developmentF whether done by an individual or a teamF requires choosing the most appropriate toolsF methodsF and approaches for a given environmentH 

software is becoming an ever larger part of the computer system and has become complicated to developF often requiring teams of programmers and years of effortH thusF the development of a large piece of software can be viewed as an engineering task to be approached with care and attention to costF reliabilityF and maintainability of the final productH the software engineering process is usually described as consisting of several phasesF called a life cycleF variously defined but generally consisting of requirements developmentF analysis and specificationF designF constructionF validationF deploymentF operationF and maintenanceH 

concern over the high failure rate of software projects has led to the development of nontraditional software development processesH notable among these is the agile software processF which includes rapid development and involves the client as an active and critical member of the teamH agile development has been effectively used in the development of openGsource softwareF which is different from proprietary software because users are free to download and modify it to fit their particular application needsH particularly successful openGsource software products include the linux operating systemF the firefox web browserF and the apache openoffice word processingIspreadsheetIpresentation suiteH 

regardless of the development methodology chosenF the software development process is expensive and timeGconsumingH since the early KSRJsF increasingly sophisticated tools have been built to aid the software developer and to automate the development process as much as possibleH such computerGaided software engineering BcaseC tools span a wide range of typesF from those that carry out the task of routine coding when given an appropriately detailed design in some specified language to those that incorporate an expert system to enforce design rules and eliminate software defects prior to the coding phaseH 

as the size and complexity of software has grownF the concept of reuse has become increasingly important in software engineeringF since it is clear that extensive new software cannot be created cheaply and rapidly without incorporating existing program modules BsubroutinesF or pieces of computer codeCH one of the attractive aspects of objectGoriented programming is that code written in terms of objects is readily reusedH as with other aspects of computer systemsF reliability Busually rather vaguely defined as the likelihood of a system to operate correctly over a reasonably long period of timeC is a key goal of the finished software productH 

sophisticated techniques for testing software have also been designedH for exampleF unit testing is a strategy for testing every individual module of a software product independently before the modules are combined into a whole and tested using integration testing techniquesH 

the need for betterGtrained software engineers has led to the development of educational programs in which software engineering is a separate majorH the recommendation that software engineersF similar to other engineersF be licensed or certified has gained increasing supportF as has the process of accreditation for software engineering degree programsH 

social and professional issues 
computer scientists must understand the relevant socialF ethicalF and professional issues that surround their activitiesH the acm code of ethics and professional conduct provides a basis for personal responsibility and professional conduct for computer scientists who are engaged in system development that directly affects the general publicH 

as the computer industry has developed increasingly powerful processors at lower costsF microprocessors have become ubiquitousH they are used to control automated assembly linesF traffic signal systemsF and retail inventory systems and are embedded in consumer products such as automobile fuelGinjection systemsF kitchen appliancesF audio systemsF cell phonesF and electronic gamesH 

computers and networks are everywhere in the workplaceH word and document processingF electronic mailF and office automation are integrated with desktop computersF printersF database systemsF and other tools using wireless networks and widespread internet accessH such changes ultimately make office work much more efficientF though not without cost for purchasing and frequently upgrading the necessary hardware and software as well as for training workers to use the new technologyH 

computerGintegrated manufacturing BcimC is a technology arising from the application of computer science to manufacturingH the technology of cim emphasizes that all aspects of manufacturing should be not only computerized as much as possible but also linked together via a networkH for exampleF the design engineer s workstation should be linked into the overall system so that design specifications and manufacturing instructions may be sent automatically to the shop floorH the inventory databases should be connected as wellF so product inventories may be incremented automatically and supply inventories decremented as manufacturing proceedsH an automated inspection system Bor a manual inspection station supplied with online terminal entryC should be linked to a qualityGcontrol system that maintains a database of quality information and alerts the manager if quality is deteriorating and possibly even provides a diagnosis as to the source of any problems that ariseH automatically tracking the flow of products from station to station on the factory floor allows an analysis program to identify bottlenecks and recommend replacement of faulty equipmentH 

for exampleF computer technology has been incorporated into automobile design and manufacturingH computers are involved Bas cad systemsC not only in the design of cars but also in the manufacturing and testing processH modern automobiles include numerous computer chips that analyze sensor data and alert the driver to actual and potential malfunctionsH although increased reliability has been achieved by implementing such computerizationF a drawback is that only automotive repair shops with a large investment in highGtech diagnostic tools for these computerized systems can handle any but the simplest repairsH 

the rapid growth of smartphones has revolutionized the telephone industryH individuals often abandoned their landlines in favour of going completely mobileU the reluctance to pay twice for telephone service was the major driver in this decisionH the telephone system itself is simply a multilevel computer network that includes radio wave links and satellite transmissionF along with software switches to route calls to their destinationsH if one node through which a crossGcountry call would normally be routed is very busyF an alternative routing can be substitutedH a disadvantage is the potential for dramatic and widespread failuresU for exampleF a poorly designed routing and flowGcontrol protocol can cause calls to cycle indefinitely among nodes without reaching their destinations unless a system administrator intervenesH 

banking and commerce have been revolutionized by computer technologyH thanks to the internetF individuals and organizations can interact with their bank accounts onlineF performing fund transfers and issuing checks from the comfort of their homes or officesH deposits and withdrawals are instantly logged into a customer s accountF which is stored on a remote serverH computerGgenerated monthly statements are unlikely to contain errorsH credit and debit card purchases are also supported by computer networksF allowing the amount of a transaction to be immediately deducted from the customer s account and transferred to the seller sH similarlyF networks allows individuals to obtain cash instantly and almost worldwide by stepping up to an automated teller machine BatmC and providing the proper card and personal identification number BpinCH 

the security challenges associated with these technologies are significantH intruders can intercept packets traveling on a network BeHgHF being transported via a satellite linkC and can decrypt them to obtain confidential information on financial transactionsH network access to personal accounts has the potential to let intruders not only see how much money an individual has but also transfer some of it elsewhereH fortunatelyF increased software security measures have made such intrusions less likelyH 

computer technology has had a significant impact on the retail industryH all but the smallest shops in places with internet access have replaced the oldGfashioned cash register with a terminal linked to a computer systemH some terminals require that the clerk type in the code for the itemF but most checkout counters include a barGcode scannerF which reads into the computer the universal product code BupcC printed on each packageH cash register receipts then include brief descriptions of the items purchased Bby fetching them from the computer databaseCF and the purchase information is also relayed back to the computer to cause an immediate adjustment in the inventory dataH the inventory system can easily alert the manager when the supply of an item drops below a specified thresholdH in the case of retail chains linked by networksF the order for a new supply of an item may be automatically generated and sent electronically to the supply warehouseH in a less extensively automated arrangementF the manager can send in the order electronically by a direct link to the supplier s computerH these developments have made shopping much more convenientH the checkout process is fasterF checkout lines are shorterF and desired items are more likely to be in stockH in additionF cash register receipts contain more detailed information than a simple list of item pricesU for exampleF many receipts include discount coupons based on the specific items purchased by the shopperH 

since the midGKSSJs one of the most rapidly growing retail sectors has been electronic commerceF involving use of the internet and proprietary networks to facilitate businessGtoGbusinessF consumerF and auction sales of everything imaginableῠfrom computers and electronics to booksF recordingsF automobilesF and real estateH popular sites for electronic commerce include amazonF ebayF and the web sites for most large retail chain storesH

mechanics is generally taken to mean the study of the motion of objects Bor their lack of motionC under the action of given forcesH classical mechanics is sometimes considered a branch of applied mathematicsH it consists of kinematicsF the description of motionF and dynamicsF the study of the action of forces in producing either motion or static equilibrium Bthe latter constituting the science of staticsCH the LJthGcentury subjects of quantum mechanicsF crucial to treating the structure of matterF subatomic particlesF superfluidityF superconductivityF neutron starsF and other major phenomenaF and relativistic mechanicsF important when speeds approach that of lightF are forms of mechanics that will be discussed later in this sectionH 

in classical mechanics the laws are initially formulated for point particles in which the dimensionsF shapesF and other intrinsic properties of bodies are ignoredH thus in the first approximation even objects as large as earth and the sun are treated as pointlikeῠeHgHF in calculating planetary orbital motionH in rigidGbody dynamicsF the extension of bodies and their mass distributions are considered as wellF but they are imagined to be incapable of deformationH the mechanics of deformable solids is elasticityU hydrostatics and hydrodynamics treatF respectivelyF fluids at rest and in motionH 

the three laws of motion set forth by isaac newton form the foundation of classical mechanicsF together with the recognition that forces are directed quantities BvectorsC and combine accordinglyH the first lawF also called the law of inertiaF states thatF unless acted upon by an external forceF an object at rest remains at restF or if in motionF it continues to move in a straight line with constant speedH uniform motion therefore does not require a causeH accordinglyF mechanics concentrates not on motion as such but on the change in the state of motion of an object that results from the net force acting upon itH newton s second law equates the net force on an object to the rate of change of its momentumF the latter being the product of the mass of a body and its velocityH newton s third lawF that of action and reactionF states that when two particles interactF the forces each exerts on the other are equal in magnitude and opposite in directionH taken togetherF these mechanical laws in principle permit the determination of the future motions of a set of particlesF providing their state of motion is known at some instantF as well as the forces that act between them and upon them from the outsideH from this deterministic character of the laws of classical mechanicsF profound Band probably incorrectC philosophical conclusions have been drawn in the past and even applied to human historyH

this field of inquiry has in the past been placed within classical mechanics for historical reasonsF because both fields were brought to a high state of perfection by newton and also because of its universal characterH newton s gravitational law states that every material particle in the universe attracts every other one with a force that acts along the line joining them and whose strength is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separationH newton s detailed accounting for the orbits of the planets and the moonF as well as for such subtle gravitational effects as the tides and the precession of the equinoxes Ba slow cyclical change in direction of earth s axis of rotationCF through this fundamental force was the first triumph of classical mechanicsH no further principles are required to understand the principal aspects of rocketry and space flight BalthoughF of courseF a formidable technology is needed to carry them outCH

the study of heatF thermodynamicsF and statistical mechanics 
temperature scales 
temperature scales 
heat is a form of internal energy associated with the random motion of the molecular constituents of matter or with radiationH temperature is an average of a part of the internal energy present in a body Bit does not include the energy of molecular binding or of molecular rotationCH the lowest possible energy state of a substance is defined as the absolute zero B⇞LQMHKO |cF or ⇞NOSHPQ |fC of temperatureH an isolated body eventually reaches uniform temperatureF a state known as thermal equilibriumF as do two or more bodies placed in contactH the formal study of states of matter at Bor nearC thermal equilibrium is called thermodynamicsU it is capable of analyzing a large variety of thermal systems without considering their detailed microstructuresH 

first law 
the first law of thermodynamics is the energy conservation principle of mechanics BiHeHF for all changes in an isolated systemF the energy remains constantC generalized to include heatH 

second law 
the second law of thermodynamics asserts that heat will not flow from a place of lower temperature to one where it is higher without the intervention of an external device BeHgHF a refrigeratorCH the concept of entropy involves the measurement of the state of disorder of the particles making up a systemH for exampleF if tossing a coin many times results in a randomGappearing sequence of heads and tailsF the result has a higher entropy than if heads and tails tend to appear in clustersH another formulation of the second law is that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases with timeH 

third law

the science of statistical mechanics derives bulk properties of systems from the mechanical properties of their molecular constituentsF assuming molecular chaos and applying the laws of probabilityH regarding each possible configuration of the particles as equally likelyF the chaotic state Bthe state of maximum entropyC is so enormously more likely than ordered states that an isolated system will evolve to itF as stated in the second law of thermodynamicsH such reasoningF placed in mathematically precise formF is typical of statistical mechanicsF which is capable of deriving the laws of thermodynamics but goes beyond them in describing fluctuations BiHeHF temporary departuresC from the thermodynamic laws that describe only average behaviourH an example of a fluctuation phenomenon is the random motion of small particles suspended in a fluidF known as brownian motionH 

quantum statistical mechanics plays a major role in many other modern fields of scienceF asF for exampleF in plasma physics Bthe study of fully ionized gasesCF in solidGstate physicsF and in the study of stellar structureH from a microscopic point of view the laws of thermodynamics imply thatF whereas the total quantity of energy of any isolated system is constantF what might be called the quality of this energy is degraded as the system moves inexorablyF through the operation of the laws of chanceF to states of increasing disorder until it finally reaches the state of maximum disorder Bmaximum entropyCF in which all parts of the system are at the same temperatureF and none of the state s energy may be usefully employedH when applied to the universe as a wholeF considered as an isolated systemF this ultimate chaotic condition has been called the heat deathH 

the study of electricity and magnetism 
although conceived of as distinct phenomena until the KSth centuryF electricity and magnetism are now known to be components of the unified field of electromagnetismH particles with electric charge interact by an electric forceF while charged particles in motion produce and respond to magnetic forces as wellH many subatomic particlesF including the electrically charged electron and proton and the electrically neutral neutronF behave like elementary magnetsH on the other handF in spite of systematic searches undertakenF no magnetic monopolesF which would be the magnetic analogues of electric chargesF have ever been foundH 

the field concept plays a central role in the classical formulation of electromagnetismF as well as in many other areas of classical and contemporary physicsH einstein s gravitational fieldF for exampleF replaces newton s concept of gravitational action at a distanceH the field describing the electric force between a pair of charged particles works in the following mannerT each particle creates an electric field in the space surrounding itF and so also at the position occupied by the other particleU each particle responds to the force exerted upon it by the electric field at its own positionH

types of electromagnetic radiation 
classical electromagnetism is summarized by the laws of action of electric and magnetic fields upon electric charges and upon magnets and by four remarkable equations formulated in the latter part of the KSth century by the scottish physicist james clerk maxwellH the latter equations describe the manner in which electric charges and currents produce electric and magnetic fieldsF as well as the manner in which changing magnetic fields produce electric fieldsF and vice versaH from these relations maxwell inferred the existence of electromagnetic wavesῠassociated electric and magnetic fields in spaceF detached from the charges that created themF traveling at the speed of lightF and endowed with such mechanical properties as energyF momentumF and angular momentumH the light to which the human eye is sensitive is but one small segment of an electromagnetic spectrum that extends from longGwavelength radio waves to shortGwavelength gamma rays and includes xGraysF microwavesF and infrared Bor heatC radiationH

during the latter half of the LJth centuryF a coherent picture evolved of the underlying strata of matter involving two types of subatomic particlesT fermions Bbaryons and leptonsCF which have odd halfGintegral angular momentum Bspin KILF MILC and make up ordinary matterU and bosons BgluonsF mesonsF and photonsCF which have integral spins and mediate the fundamental forces of physicsH leptons BeHgHF electronsF muonsF tausCF gluonsF and photons are believed to be truly fundamental particlesH baryons BeHgHF neutronsF protonsC and mesons BeHgHF pionsF kaonsCF collectively known as hadronsF are believed to be formed from indivisible elements known as quarksF which have never been isolatedH 

quarks come in six typesF or flavoursF and have matching antiparticlesF known as antiquarksH quarks have charges that are either positive twoGthirds or negative oneGthird of the electron s chargeF while antiquarks have the opposite chargesH like quarksF each lepton has an antiparticle with properties that mirror those of its partner Bthe antiparticle of the negatively charged electron is the positive electronF or positronU that of the neutrino is the antineutrinoCH in addition to their electric and magnetic propertiesF quarks participate in both the strong force Bwhich binds them togetherC and the weak force Bwhich underlies certain forms of radioactivityCF while leptons take part in only the weak forceH

although the various branches of physics differ in their experimental methods and theoretical approachesF certain general principles apply to all of themH the forefront of contemporary advances in physics lies in the submicroscopic regimeF whether it be in atomicF nuclearF condensedGmatterF plasmaF or particle physicsF or in quantum opticsF or even in the study of stellar structureH all are based upon quantum theory BiHeHF quantum mechanics and quantum field theoryC and relativityF which together form the theoretical foundations of modern physicsH many physical quantities whose classical counterparts vary continuously over a range of possible values are in quantum theory constrained to have discontinuousF or discreteF valuesH furthermoreF the intrinsically deterministic character of values in classical physics is replaced in quantum theory by intrinsic uncertaintyH

in principleF all of atomic and molecular physicsF including the structure of atoms and their dynamicsF the periodic table of elements and their chemical behaviourF as well as the spectroscopicF electricalF and other physical properties of atomsF moleculesF and condensed matterF can be accounted for by quantum mechanicsH roughly speakingF the electrons in the atom must fit around the nucleus as some sort of standing wave Bas given by the schrÂdinger equationC analogous to the waves on a plucked violin or guitar stringH as the fit determines the wavelength of the quantum waveF it necessarily determines its energy stateH consequentlyF atomic systems are restricted to certain discreteF or quantizedF energiesH when an atom undergoes a discontinuous transitionF or quantum jumpF its energy changes abruptly by a sharply defined amountF and a photon of that energy is emitted when the energy of the atom decreasesF or is absorbed in the opposite caseH 

although atomic energies can be sharply definedF the positions of the electrons within the atom cannot beF quantum mechanics giving only the probability for the electrons to have certain locationsH this is a consequence of the feature that distinguishes quantum theory from all other approaches to physicsF the uncertainty principle of the german physicist werner heisenbergH this principle holds that measuring a particle s position with increasing precision necessarily increases the uncertainty as to the particle s momentumF and converselyH the ultimate degree of uncertainty is controlled by the magnitude of planck s constantF which is so small as to have no apparent effects except in the world of microstructuresH in the latter caseF howeverF because both a particle s position and its velocity or momentum must be known precisely at some instant in order to predict its future historyF quantum theory precludes such certain prediction and thus escapes determinismH

the complementary wave and particle aspectsF or waveῖparticle dualityF of electromagnetic radiation and of material particles furnish another illustration of the uncertainty principleH when an electron exhibits wavelike behaviourF as in the phenomenon of electron diffractionF this excludes its exhibiting particleGlike behaviour in the same observationH similarlyF when electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons interacts with matterF as in the compton effect in which xGray photons collide with electronsF the result resembles a particleGlike collision and the wave nature of electromagnetic radiation is precludedH the principle of complementarityF asserted by the danish physicist niels bohrF who pioneered the theory of atomic structureF states that the physical world presents itself in the form of various complementary picturesF no one of which is by itself completeF all of these pictures being essential for our total understandingH thus both wave and particle pictures are needed for understanding either the electron or the photonH 

although it deals with probabilities and uncertaintiesF the quantum theory has been spectacularly successful in explaining otherwise inaccessible atomic phenomena and in thus far meeting every experimental testH its predictionsF especially those of qedF are the most precise and the best checked of any in physicsU some of them have been tested and found accurate to better than one part per billionH 

relativistic mechanics 
in classical physicsF space is conceived as having the absolute character of an empty stage in which events in nature unfold as time flows onward independentlyU events occurring simultaneously for one observer are presumed to be simultaneous for any otherU mass is taken as impossible to create or destroyU and a particle given sufficient energy acquires a velocity that can increase without limitH the special theory of relativityF developed principally by albert einstein in KSJO and now so adequately confirmed by experiment as to have the status of physical lawF shows that all theseF as well as other apparently obvious assumptionsF are falseH 

specific and unusual relativistic effects flow directly from einstein s two basic postulatesF which are formulated in terms of soGcalled inertial reference framesH these are reference systems that move in such a way that in them isaac newton s first lawF the law of inertiaF is validH the set of inertial frames consists of all those that move with constant velocity with respect to each other Baccelerating frames therefore being excludedCH einstein s postulates areT BKC all observersF whatever their state of motion relative to a light sourceF measure the same speed for lightU and BLC the laws of physics are the same in all inertial framesH 

length contraction and time dilation 
length contraction and time dilation 
the first postulateF the constancy of the speed of lightF is an experimental fact from which follow the distinctive relativistic phenomena of space contraction Bor lorentzGfitzgerald contractionCF time dilationF and the relativity of simultaneityT as measured by an observer assumed to be at restF an object in motion is contracted along the direction of its motionF and moving clocks run slowU two spatially separated events that are simultaneous for a stationary observer occur sequentially for a moving observerH as a consequenceF space intervals in threeGdimensional space are related to time intervalsF thus forming soGcalled fourGdimensional spaceGtimeH 

the second postulate is called the principle of relativityH it is equally valid in classical mechanics Bbut not in classical electrodynamics until einstein reinterpreted itCH this postulate impliesF for exampleF that table tennis played on a train moving with constant velocity is just like table tennis played with the train at restF the states of rest and motion being physically indistinguishableH in relativity theoryF mechanical quantities such as momentum and energy have forms that are different from their classical counterparts but give the same values for speeds that are small compared to the speed of lightF the maximum permissible speed in nature Babout MJJFJJJ kilometres per secondF or KRPFJJJ miles per secondCH according to relativityF mass and energy are equivalent and interchangeable quantitiesF the equivalence being expressed by einstein s famous massGenergy equation e W mcLF where m is an object s mass and c is the speed of lightH 

the general theory of relativity is einstein s theory of gravitationF which uses the principle of the equivalence of gravitation and locally accelerating frames of referenceH einstein s theory has special mathematical beautyU it generalizes the flat spaceGtime concept of special relativity to one of curvatureH it forms the background of all modern cosmological theoriesH in contrast to some vulgarized popular notions of itF which confuse it with moral and other forms of relativismF einstein s theory does not argue that all is relativeH on the contraryF it is largely a theory based upon those physical attributes that do not changeF orF in the language of the theoryF that are invariantH 

conservation laws and symmetry 
since the early period of modern physicsF there have been conservation lawsF which state that certain physical quantitiesF such as the total electric charge of an isolated system of bodiesF do not change in the course of timeH in the LJth century it has been proved mathematically that such laws follow from the symmetry properties of natureF as expressed in the laws of physicsH the conservation of massGenergy of an isolated systemF for exampleF follows from the assumption that the laws of physics may depend upon time intervals but not upon the specific time at which the laws are appliedH the symmetries and the conservation laws that follow from them are regarded by modern physicists as being even more fundamental than the laws themselvesF since they are able to limit the possible forms of laws that may be proposed in the futureH 

conservation laws are valid in classicalF relativisticF and quantum theory for massGenergyF momentumF angular momentumF and electric chargeH Bin nonrelativistic physicsF mass and energy are separately conservedHC momentumF a directed quantity equal to the mass of a body multiplied by its velocity or to the total mass of two or more bodies multiplied by the velocity of their centre of massF is conserved whenF and only whenF no external force actsH similarly angular momentumF which is related to spinning motionsF is conserved in a system upon which no net turning forceF called torqueF actsH external forces and torques break the symmetry conditions from which the respective conservation laws followH 

in quantum theoryF and especially in the theory of elementary particlesF there are additional symmetries and conservation lawsF some exact and others only approximately validF which play no significant role in classical physicsH among these are the conservation of soGcalled quantum numbers related to leftGright reflection symmetry of space Bcalled parityC and to the reversal symmetry of motion Bcalled time reversalCH these quantum numbers are conserved in all processes other than the weak forceH 

other symmetry properties not obviously related to space and time Band referred to as internal symmetriesC characterize the different families of elementary particles andF by extensionF their compositesH quarksF for exampleF have a property called baryon numberF as do protonsF neutronsF nucleiF and unstable quark compositesH all of these except the quarks are known as baryonsH a failure of baryonGnumber conservation would exhibit itselfF for instanceF by a proton decaying into lighter nonGbaryonic particlesH indeedF intensive search for such proton decay has been conductedF but so far it has been fruitlessH similar symmetries and conservation laws hold for an analogously defined lepton numberF and they also appearF as does the law of baryon conservationF to hold absolutelyH

fission 
fission 
the four basic forces of natureF in order of increasing strengthF are thought to beT BKC the gravitational force between particles with massU BLC the electromagnetic force between particles with charge or magnetism or bothU BMC the colour forceF or strong forceF between quarksU and BNC the weak force by whichF for exampleF quarks can change their typeF so that a neutron decays into a protonF an electronF and an antineutrinoH the strong force that binds protons and neutrons into nuclei and is responsible for fissionF fusionF and other nuclear reactions is in principle derived from the colour forceH nuclear physics is thus related to qcd as chemistry is to atomic physicsH 

according to quantum field theoryF each of the four fundamental interactions is mediated by the exchange of quantaF called vector gauge bosonsF which share certain common characteristicsH all have an intrinsic spin of one unitF measured in terms of planck s constant ⃛H Bleptons and quarks each have oneGhalf unit of spinHC gauge theory studies the group of transformationsF or lie groupF that leaves the basic physics of a quantum field invariantH lie groupsF which are named for the KSthGcentury norwegian mathematician sophus lieF possess a special type of symmetry and continuity that made them first useful in the study of differential equations on smooth manifolds Ban abstract mathematical space for modeling physical processesCH this symmetry was first seen in the equations for electromagnetic potentialsF quantities from which electromagnetic fields can be derivedH it is possessed in pure form by the eight massless gluons of qcdF but in the electroweak theoryῠthe unified theory of electromagnetic and weak force interactionsῠgauge symmetry is partially brokenF so that only the photon remains masslessF with the other gauge bosons BwEF w⇞F and zC acquiring large massesH theoretical physicists continue to seek a further unification of qcd with the electroweak theory andF more ambitiously stillF to unify them with a quantum version of gravity in which the force would be transmitted by massless quanta of two units of spin called gravitonsH 

the methodology of physics 
physics has evolved and continues to evolve without any single strategyH essentially an experimental scienceF refined measurements can reveal unexpected behaviourH on the other handF mathematical extrapolation of existing theories into new theoretical areasF critical reexamination of apparently obvious but untested assumptionsF argument by symmetry or analogyF aesthetic judgmentF pure accidentF and hunchῠeach of these plays a role Bas in all of scienceCH thusF for exampleF the quantum hypothesis proposed by the german physicist max planck was based on observed departures of the character of blackbody radiation Bradiation emitted by a heated body that absorbs all radiant energy incident upon itC from that predicted by classical electromagnetismH the english physicist pHaHmH dirac predicted the existence of the positron in making a relativistic extension of the quantum theory of the electronH the elusive neutrinoF without mass or chargeF was hypothesized by the german physicist wolfgang pauli as an alternative to abandoning the conservation laws in the betaGdecay processH maxwell conjectured that if changing magnetic fields create electric fields Bwhich was known to be soCF then changing electric fields might create magnetic fieldsF leading him to the electromagnetic theory of lightH albert einstein s special theory of relativity was based on a critical reexamination of the meaning of simultaneityF while his general theory of relativity rests on the equivalence of inertial and gravitational massH 

although the tactics may vary from problem to problemF the physicist invariably tries to make unsolved problems more tractable by constructing a series of idealized modelsF with each successive model being a more realistic representation of the actual physical situationH thusF in the theory of gasesF the molecules are at first imagined to be particles that are as structureless as billiard balls with vanishingly small dimensionsH this ideal picture is then improved on step by stepH 

the correspondence principleF a useful guiding principle for extending theoretical interpretationsF was formulated by the danish physicist niels bohr in the context of the quantum theoryH it asserts that when a valid theory is generalized to a broader arenaF the new theory s predictions must agree with the old one in the overlapping region in which both are applicableH for exampleF the more comprehensive theory of physical optics must yield the same result as the more restrictive theory of ray optics whenever wave effects proportional to the wavelength of light are negligible on account of the smallness of that wavelengthH similarlyF quantum mechanics must yield the same results as classical mechanics in circumstances when planck s constant can be considered as negligibly smallH likewiseF for speeds small compared to the speed of light Bas for baseballs in playCF relativistic mechanics must coincide with newtonian classical mechanicsH 

some ways in which experimental and theoretical physicists attack their problems are illustrated by the following examplesH 

the modern experimental study of elementary particles began with the detection of new types of unstable particles produced in the atmosphere by primary radiationF the latter consisting mainly of highGenergy protons arriving from spaceH the new particles were detected in geiger counters and identified by the tracks they left in instruments called cloud chambers and in photographic platesH after world war iiF particle physicsF then known as highGenergy nuclear physicsF became a major field of scienceH today s highGenergy particle accelerators can be several kilometres in lengthF cost hundreds Bor even thousandsC of millions of dollarsF and accelerate particles to enormous energies Btrillions of electron voltsCH experimental teamsF such as those that discovered the wEF w⇞F and z quanta of the weak force at the european laboratory for particle physics BcernC in genevaF which is funded by its LJ european member statesF can have KJJ or more physicists from many countriesF along with a larger number of technical workers serving as support personnelH a variety of visual and electronic techniques are used to interpret and sort the huge amounts of data produced by their effortsF and particleGphysics laboratories are major users of the most advanced technologyF be it superconductive magnets or supercomputersH 

theoretical physicists use mathematics both as a logical tool for the development of theory and for calculating predictions of the theory to be compared with experimentH newtonF for oneF invented integral calculus to solve the following problemF which was essential to his formulation of the law of universal gravitationT assuming that the attractive force between any pair of point particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating themF how does a spherical distribution of particlesF such as earthF attract another nearby objecty integral calculusF a procedure for summing many small contributionsF yields the simple solution that earth itself acts as a point particle with all its mass concentrated at the centreH in modern physicsF dirac predicted the existence of the thenGunknown positive electron Bor positronC by finding an equation for the electron that would combine quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativityH 

relations between physics and other disciplines and society 
influence of physics on related disciplines 
because physics elucidates the simplest fundamental questions in nature on which there can be a consensusF it is hardly surprising that it has had a profound impact on other fields of scienceF on philosophyF on the worldview of the developed worldF andF of courseF on technologyH 

indeedF whenever a branch of physics has reached such a degree of maturity that its basic elements are comprehended in general principlesF it has moved from basic to applied physics and thence to technologyH thus almost all current activity in classical physics consists of applied physicsF and its contents form the core of many branches of engineeringH discoveries in modern physics are converted with increasing rapidity into technical innovations and analytical tools for associated disciplinesH there areF for exampleF such nascent fields as nuclear and biomedical engineeringF quantum chemistry and quantum opticsF and radioF xGrayF and gammaGray astronomyF as well as such analytic tools as radioisotopesF spectroscopyF and lasersF which all stem directly from basic physicsH 

apart from its specific applicationsF physicsῠespecially newtonian mechanicsῠhas become the prototype of the scientific methodF its experimental and analytic methods sometimes being imitated Band sometimes inappropriately soC in fields far from the related physical sciencesH some of the organizational aspects of physicsF based partly on the successes of the radar and atomicGbomb projects of world war iiF also have been imitated in largeGscale scientific projectsF asF for exampleF in astronomy and space researchH 

the great influence of physics on the branches of philosophy concerned with the conceptual basis of human perceptions and understanding of natureF such as epistemologyF is evidenced by the earlier designation of physics itself as natural philosophyH presentGday philosophy of science deals largelyF though not exclusivelyF with the foundations of physicsH determinismF the philosophical doctrine that the universe is a vast machine operating with strict causality whose future is determined in all detail by its present stateF is rooted in newtonian mechanicsF which obeys that principleH moreoverF the schools of materialismF naturalismF and empiricism have in large degree considered physics to be a model for philosophical inquiryH an extreme position is taken by the logical positivistsF whose radical distrust of the reality of anything not directly observable leads them to demand that all significant statements must be formulated in the language of physicsH 

the uncertainty principle of quantum theory has prompted a reexamination of the question of determinismF and its other philosophical implications remain in doubtH particularly problematic is the matter of the meaning of measurementF for which recent theories and experiments confirm some apparently noncausal predictions of standard quantum theoryH it is fair to say that though physicists agree that quantum theory worksF they still differ as to what it meansH

the relationship of physics to its bordering disciplines is a reciprocal oneH just as technology feeds on fundamental science for new practical innovationsF so physics appropriates the techniques and instrumentation of modern technology for advancing itselfH thus experimental physicists utilize increasingly refined and precise electronic devicesH moreoverF they work closely with engineers in designing basic scientific equipmentF such as highGenergy particle acceleratorsH mathematics has always been the primary tool of the theoretical physicistF and even abstruse fields of mathematics such as group theory and differential geometry have become invaluable to the theoretician classifying subatomic particles or investigating the symmetry characteristics of atoms and moleculesH much of contemporary research in physics depends on the highGspeed computerH it allows the theoretician to perform computations that are too lengthy or complicated to be done with paper and pencilH alsoF it allows experimentalists to incorporate the computer into their apparatusF so that the results of measurements can be provided nearly instantaneously onGline as summarized data while an experiment is in progressH 

the physicist in society 
protonGantiproton collision 
protonGantiproton collision 
because of the remoteness of much of contemporary physics from ordinary experience and its reliance on advanced mathematicsF physicists have sometimes seemed to the public to be initiates in a latterGday secular priesthood who speak an arcane language and can communicate their findings to laymen only with great difficultyH yetF the physicist has come to play an increasingly significant role in societyF particularly since world war iiH governments have supplied substantial funds for research at academic institutions and at government laboratories through such agencies as the national science foundation and the department of energy in the united statesF which has also established a number of national laboratoriesF including the fermi national accelerator laboratory in bataviaF illHF with one of the world s largest particle acceleratorsH cern is composed of KN european countries and operates a large accelerator at the swissῖfrench borderH physics research is supported in germany by the max planck society for the advancement of science and in japan by the japan society for the promotion of scienceH in triesteF italyF there is the international center for theoretical physicsF which has strong ties to developing countriesH these are only a few examples of the widespread international interest in fundamental physicsH 

basic research in physics is obviously dependent on public support and fundingF and with this development has comeF albeit slowlyF a growing recognition within the physics community of the social responsibility of scientists for the consequences of their work and for the more general problems of science and societyH

law of inertiaF also called newton s first lawF postulate in physics thatF if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight lineF it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a forceH the law of inertia was first formulated by galileo galilei for horizontal motion on earth and was later generalized by renÕ descartesH before galileo it had been thought that all horizontal motion required a direct causeF but galileo deduced from his experiments that a body in motion would remain in motion unless a force Bsuch as frictionC caused it to come to restH this law is also the first of isaac newton s three laws of motionH 

although the principle of inertia is the starting point and the fundamental assumption of classical mechanicsF it is less than intuitively obvious to the untrained eyeH in aristotelian mechanicsF and in ordinary experienceF objects that are not being pushed tend to come to restH the law of inertia was deduced by galileo from his experiments with balls rolling down inclined planesH

priestley s interest in science intensified in KQPOF when he met the american scientist and statesman benjamin franklinF who encouraged him to publish the history and present state of electricityF with original experiments BKQPQCH in this workF priestley used history to show that scientific progress depended more on the accumulation of new facts that anyone could discover than on the theoretical insights of a few men of geniusH priestley s preference for facts over hypotheses in science was consistent with his dissenting conviction that prejudice and dogma of any sort presented obstacles to individual inquiry and private judgmentH

this view of scientific methodology shaped priestley s electrical experimentsF in which he anticipated the inverse square law of electrical attractionF discovered that charcoal conducts electricityF and noted the relationship between electricity and chemical changeH on the basis of these experimentsF in KQPP he was elected a member of the royal society of londonH this line of investigation inspired him to develop a larger field of original experiments in areas other than electricityH

that same year priestley moved to calneF wiltshireF where he served as librarian and tutor for william pettyF earl of shelburneF and his familyH here he sought and gained further evidence supporting his newly found belief in a benevolent god rather than the vengeful god of his calvinist youthH upon contemplating the processes of vegetation and the agitation of seas and lakesF priestley envisioned the means by which a benevolent nature restored the common air that had been vitiated and diminished by such noxious processes as combustion and respirationH apart from strengthening his own spiritual viewsF these observations informed the photosynthesis experiments performed by his contemporariesF the dutch physician jan ingenhousz and the swiss clergyman and naturalist jean senebierH 

priestley viewed his scientific pursuits as consistent with the commercial and entrepreneurial interests of english dissentersH he embraced the KQthGcentury statesman and natural philosopher francis bacon s argument that social progress required the development of a scienceGbased commerceH this view was reinforced when he moved to become a preacher at the new meeting house in birmingham in KQRJ and became a member of the lunar societyF an elite group of local gentlemenF dissentersF and industrialists Bincluding josiah wedgwoodF erasmus darwinF james wattF and matthew boultonCF who applied the principles of science and technology toward the solving of problems experienced in KRthGcentury urban lifeH when confronted by the multitude of diseases that plagued the growing populations in towns and military installationsF priestley designed an apparatus that produced carbonated waterF a mixture that he thought would provide medicinal benefit to sufferers of scurvy and various feversH although it ultimately proved ineffective in treating these disordersF the gasogene that employed this technique later made possible the sodaGwater industryH priestley also designed the eudiometerF which was used in the general movement for sanitary reform and urban design to measure the purity Boxygen contentC of atmospheric airH contemporary interest in pneumatic medicine culminated in the shortGlived pneumatic institutionF which the physician and chemist thomas beddoes founded in bristol in KQSR in order to ascertain the effects of different airs on a variety of common ailmentsH 

the discovery of oxygen and the chemical revolution of joseph priestley 
priestley s lasting reputation in science is founded upon the discovery he made on august KF KQQNF when he obtained a colourless gas by heating red mercuric oxideH finding that a candle would burn and that a mouse would thrive in this gasF he called it dephlogisticated airF based upon the belief that ordinary air became saturated with phlogiston once it could no longer support combustion and lifeH priestley was not yet sureF howeverF that he had discovered a new species of airH the following octoberF he accompanied his patronF shelburneF on a journey through belgiumF hollandF germanyF and franceF where in paris he informed the french chemist antoine lavoisier how he obtained the new airH this meeting between the two scientists was highly significant for the future of chemistryH lavoisier immediately repeated priestley s experiments andF between KQQO and KQRJF conducted intensive investigations from which he derived the elementary nature of oxygenF recognized it as the active principle in the atmosphereF interpreted its role in combustion and respirationF and gave it its nameH lavoisier s pronouncements of the activity of oxygen revolutionized chemistryH 

priestley did not accept all of lavoisier s conclusions and continuedF in particularF to uphold the phlogiston theoryH convinced that the french chemists were imposing their beliefs on the scientific community in ways similar to the anglican establishment of religious and political dogmaF priestley s dissenter leanings strengthened his opposition to lavoisier s new system of chemistryH to clarify his positionF in KRJJ he published a slim pamphletF doctrine of phlogiston establishedF and that of the composition of water refutedF which he expanded to book length in KRJMH the doctrine of phlogiston provided a detailed account of what he envisioned to be the empiricalF theoreticalF and methodological shortcomings of the oxygen theoryH priestley called for a patientF humbleF experimental approach to god s infinite creationH chemistry could support piety and liberty only if it avoided speculative theorizing and encouraged the observation of god s benevolent creationH the phlogiston theory was superseded by lavoisier s oxidation theory of combustion and respirationH

science was an important part of priestley s rational christianityH in institutes of natural and revealed religion BKQQLῖQNCF he described how he rejected the gloomy calvinist doctrines of the natural depravity of man and the inscrutable will of a vengeful godH priestley used psychologist and liberal anglican david hartley s doctrine of association of ideas to support his view that mankind s perfectibility was the inevitable consequence of a growing awareness of man s place in a deterministic system of benevolenceH in an history of the corruptions of christianity BKQRLCF priestley claimed that the doctrines of materialismF determinismF and socinianism BunitarianismC were consistent with a rational reading of the bibleH he insisted that jesus christ was a mere man who preached the resurrection of the body rather than the immortality of a nonexistent soulH 

in KQPO he was awarded an llHdH from the university of edinburgh for his educational and literary accomplishments at warringtonH these included his writings on theory of language and universal grammar BKQPLCF an essay on a course of liberal education for civil and active life BKQPOCF and lectures on history and general policy Bprepared at warrington but not published until KQRRCH priestley used the doctrine of association of ideas to support his views on languageF historyF and education as wellH in particularF he based what he deemed to be the correct use of language on the customary association of ideasH he also employed teaching techniques that were based on the experiences of his students and were designed to prepare them for a practical lifeH 

priestley united theory and practice in his work in politicsH in KQPQ he became involved in the dissenter s national struggle against the test and corporation act BKPPKC that restricted their civil and political libertiesH in an essay on the first principles of government BKQPRCF he argued that scientific progress and human perfectibility required freedom of speechF worshipF and educationH as a proponent of laissezGfaire economicsF developed by the scottish philosopher adam smithF priestley sought to limit the role of government and to evaluate its effectiveness solely in terms of the welfare of the individualH the english economist and founder of utilitarianism jeremy bentham acknowledged that priestley s influential book inspired the phrase used to depict his own movementF the greatest happiness of the greatest numberH 

turmoil and exile 
the english press and government decreed that priestley s supportF together with that of his friendF the moral philosopher richard priceF of the american and french revolutions was seditiousH on july KNF KQSKF the churchGandGking mob destroyed priestley s house and laboratoryH priestley and his family retreated to the security of price s congregation at hackneyF near londonH priestley later began teaching at new collegeF oxfordF and defended his antiGbritish government views in letters to the right honourable edmund burke BKQSKCH 

priestley s defense fell on deaf ears as the conservative reaction to the french revolution intensified in englandH in KQSN he fled to the united statesF where he discovered a form of government that was relatively tolerableH his bestGknown writing in the united statesF letters to the inhabitants of northumberland BKQSSCF became part of the republican response to the federalistsH priestley died at northumberlandF pennsylvaniaF mourned and revered by thomas jeffersonF the third president of the united statesH
